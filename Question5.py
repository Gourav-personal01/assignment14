#Differentiate between REST and SOAP.

#1. SOAP API exposes the operation whereas REST API exposes the data.
#2. SOAP is independent and can work with any transport protocol wheras REST works only with HTTPS.
#3. SOAP supports only XML data exchange whereas REST supports XML, JSON, plain text, HTML.
#4. SOAP supports encryption with additional overheads whereas REST supports encryption without affecting performance.
